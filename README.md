# JomSocial notifications plugin

This is a Joomla com_community 2.8 plugin which serves two purposes:

* Sends notifications to group members when a photo has been added to one of this group's albums
* Sends notifications to group members when a comment has been added under one of this group's posts

All notifications are sent via email, using JomSocial's mail queue. Emails are HTML-formatted.
